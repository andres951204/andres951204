# 👋 Hi there, I'm Andres Acevedo

I'm someone who truly enjoys technical challenges. Lately, I've been deepening my understanding of the tools I work with, aiming for more technical mastery. I'm always open to learning new things and stepping outside of my comfort zone to grow as a developer.

## 🧰 Technologies I Work With

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5  
- **Frontend:** ReactJS, React Native, Expo, TailwindCSS, Styled Components, SCSS

## 🚀 Work Highlights

Most of my development experience has been in delivering real-world solutions for companies rather than personal projects. I've contributed to systems in diverse industries including finance, healthcare, ERP platforms, security services (e.g., watchman companies), and e-commerce.  

Currently, I'm working with **LifeLoop**, a software platform designed to manage senior living communities. My role involves implementing a wide range of new features and improvements that support daily operations and enhance the user experience.
